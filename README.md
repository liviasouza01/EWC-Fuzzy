This repository contains supplementary materials for the research paper **"Incremental learning approach using fuzzy logic to mitigate catastrophic forgetting"** (currently under review).

## Repository Contents

### Tables and Results
- **Experimental Results**: Comprehensive tables showing performance metrics across different datasets and configurations
- **Comparative Analysis**: Results comparing our fuzzy logic-enhanced approach against baseline methods
- **Statistical Analysis**: Detailed statistical evaluations of the proposed method's effectiveness

### Key Contributions

Our research addresses the critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by:

1. **Fuzzy Logic Integration**: Incorporating fuzzy logic principles into the EWC framework to provide more nuanced importance weighting of neural network parameters
2. **Adaptive Parameter Protection**: Using fuzzy inference systems to dynamically adjust the protection level of network weights based on their importance and uncertainty
3. **Improved Knowledge Retention**: Demonstrating enhanced performance in preserving previously learned tasks while learning new ones

## Methodology

The proposed approach leverages:
- **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** as the base continual learning framework
- **Fuzzy Logic Systems** for intelligent parameter importance assessment
- **Adaptive Regularization** to balance stability and plasticity in neural networks

## Datasets and Experiments

The experimental evaluation includes results on standard continual learning benchmarks, with detailed performance metrics provided in the accompanying tables.
